Raspberry Pi
Raspberry Pi is a series of compact, low-cost, single-board computers developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It is widely used for educational purposes, prototyping, and DIY projects.

Key Features:

Processor: ARM-based CPU (varies by model; e.g., Quad-core Cortex-A72 on Raspberry Pi 4)
RAM: Varies by model (e.g., 2GB, 4GB, 8GB on Raspberry Pi 4)
Storage: MicroSD card slot (for operating system and data storage)
Connectivity: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth (varies by model)
USB Ports: Multiple USB 2.0/3.0 ports (varies by model)
GPIO Pins: 40-pin header for interfacing with sensors, actuators, and other peripherals
Specifications:

Operating Voltage: 5V via USB-C or micro USB (depending on the model)
Video Output: HDMI and/or composite video (varies by model)
Audio Output: 3.5mm jack or HDMI (varies by model)
Programming:

Languages: Supports various programming languages including Python, C++, Java, and Scratch.
Operating Systems: Runs Linux-based OS such as Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian), Ubuntu, or specialized distributions like LibreELEC for media centers.
Applications:

Education: Used to teach programming, electronics, and computer science.
Prototyping: Ideal for developing and testing hardware and software projects.
DIY Projects: Commonly used in home automation, robotics, media centers, and more.
Advantages:

Affordability: Low-cost compared to traditional computers.
Versatility: Suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple learning tools to complex systems.
Community Support: Large community with extensive resources, tutorials, and project ideas.
Popular Models:

Raspberry Pi 4: High-performance model with multiple RAM options, USB 3.0, and dual 4K video support.
Raspberry Pi Zero: Ultra-compact and cost-effective, ideal for smaller projects.
Raspberry Pi Pico: Microcontroller-based board for low-power applications.
Getting Started:

Setup: Insert a microSD card with an OS into the Raspberry Pi, connect peripherals (keyboard, mouse, monitor), and power it up.
Install OS: Use Raspberry Pi Imager to write the OS image to the microSD card.
Configure: Set up your Raspberry Pi and configure network settings as needed.
Develop: Write and run code using the integrated development environment or terminal.
The Raspberry Pi provides a versatile and accessible platform for exploring computing, electronics, and programming.

Jumper Wires: A Brief Overview
What Are Jumper Wires?

Jumper wires are short, insulated wires with connectors (pins) at each end, used to connect components on a breadboard or between breadboard and other electronic components.
Types:

Male-to-Male: Pins on both ends, used for connecting points on a breadboard.
Male-to-Female: Pin on one end, socket on the other, for connecting a breadboard to components like sensors.
Female-to-Female: Sockets on both ends, used to connect two components with male headers.
Uses:

Prototyping: Easily connect and disconnect components.
Circuit Testing: Quickly modify circuit connections without soldering.
Educational Projects: Perfect for beginners learning electronics.
Advantages:

Flexible: Available in various lengths and colors.
Reusable: Easily removed and reinserted for different projects.
Versatile: Compatible with breadboards, microcontrollers (like Arduino), and other components.
Jumper wires are essential tools for creating and modifying circuits in a hassle-free manner, making them indispensable in prototyping, education, and hobby electronics.
